There are several techniques to reach that goal, among which tomographic inversion is an efficient one. As an upgrade version of handpicked velocity analysis, the tomography technique is based on the reflection ray tracing and conjugate gradient method to estimate an optimum velocity model and can create an initial high quality model for other intensive imaging and modelling module such as reverse-time migration (RTM) and full-waveform inversion (FWI). For the mentioned benefit, we develop a seismic travel-time reflection tomography (SeisT) module to study the accuracy of the approach along with building the technical capability in seismic processing. The accuracy of the module has been tested by both synthetic and real seismic field data; the efficiency and the accuracy of the model have been proven in terms of development method as well as field data application.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, journal={Petrovietnam Journal}, author={Pham, The Hoang Ha and Doan, Huy Hien and Ta, Quang Minh and Mai , Thi Lua and Nguyen , Hoang Anh}, year={2021}, month={Nov.}, pages={4 -16} }
