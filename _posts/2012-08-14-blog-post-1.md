Recently, I was featured in a national article in Vietnam.vn, which highlighted my journey from a student in Vietnam to pursuing my dreams of working at NASA. Reflecting on my path, I’m reminded of the challenges I faced and the perseverance it took to get here.

From Security Studies to Science
======
My academic journey began at the People's Security Academy, but my passion for science soon led me in a different direction. I pursued and earned two master’s degrees—one in Physics and another in Earth Science—before moving to the U.S. to continue my studies.


Aiming for the Stars
======
Now, as a PhD student in Geophysics at the Colorado School of Mines, my goal is to contribute to NASA’s mission of exploring space. It’s been a long road, but I’m motivated by the endless possibilities that lie ahead.

Looking Ahead
======
My story is far from over. Each day, I strive to learn more, overcome obstacles, and get closer to achieving my dream. I’m grateful for the support from my family, friends, and mentors, who have believed in me every step of the way.
