Traveling has always been a part of who I am. It’s not just about the destinations, but the experiences, the people, and the cultures that shape my journey. I come from Vietnam, a country rich in history and tradition, but my curiosity about the world has led me far beyond its borders.

#### From Vietnam to Italy: Two Years of Discovery

After finishing my studies in Vietnam, I moved to Italy, where I spent two incredible years immersing myself in the culture and beauty of this fascinating country. Italy became a second home to me, from the historic streets of Rome to the artistic treasures of Florence. I fell in love with the language, the food, and most importantly, the way of life. Italy taught me to appreciate the art of living slowly and savoring every moment.

#### The Next Chapter: Life in the United States

Today, I find myself in the United States, a country of vast landscapes and endless opportunities. Moving from Italy to the U.S. was a significant change, but one that has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. Here, I’ve explored iconic cities like New York and San Francisco, each with its own unique vibe. The diversity and dynamism of the U.S. continue to inspire me every day as I work towards my dreams and goals.

#### Looking Back and Moving Forward

As I reflect on my journey, I realize how each country I’ve lived in has left a mark on who I am today. Vietnam, Italy, and now the United States have each shaped my worldview in different ways. But this journey is far from over. There are still so many places to explore, people to meet, and cultures to experience. The world is vast, and I am eager to continue discovering it.
