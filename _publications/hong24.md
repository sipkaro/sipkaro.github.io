excerpt: 'In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to develop a large model (19,998 atoms) of liquid SiO<sub>2</sub> at 3500 K. We construct models at different pressures in the 0-100 GPa range using the BKS potential and periodic boundary conditions. The goal is to detail the structural transition from the polyamorphic liquid state of SiO<sub>2</sub> to the crystalline stishovite form, which occurs between 45 and 60 GPa. We analyze the polyamorphic state of liquid SiO<sub>2</sub> by examining the formation of SiO<sub>x</sub> clusters from 2 GPa to 60 GPa. Beyond 60 GPa, the Pair Radial Distribution Functions (PRDFs) for Si-O, O-O, and Si-Si display multiple peaks, indicating the crystalline phase. This observation is further supported by examining the bond angle distribution, the fraction of SiO<sub>x</sub> units and OSi<sub>x</sub> linkages, Si-O bond lengths within SiO<sub>x</sub> units, structural visualizations, and the analysis of ring statistics in the liquid SiO<sub>2</sub> system, all of which underscore the comprehensive changes in the systemâ€™s structure.'
