excerpt: 'The microstructure in Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> glass under high compression is studied by molecular dynamics method. This work revealed the correlation between pair radial distribution functions (PRDF) of Si-Si pair and bond angle distribution (BAD) of Si-O-Si and focuses on clarifying the split peak of Si-Si PRDF. Moreover, visualizing the bonds of Si-Si at different pressures shows the changing of Si-Si bonds with pressure. In particular, as pressure increases, it forms corner-sharing, edge-sharing, and face-sharing bonds between SiO<sub>x</sub> coordination units, resulting in the first peak splitting of Si-Si PRDF at high pressure. The results of Si-Siâ€™s PRDF have also been analyzed and explained in detail.
