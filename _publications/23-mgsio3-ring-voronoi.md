The structural change of MgSiO<sub>3</sub> liquid under compression is still one of the most interesting challenges. In this paper, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the structural change of MgSiO<sub>3</sub> liquid from 0 to 200 GPa. Ring statistics are analyzed to clarify the intermediate-range order, to explain why the second peak of Si–Si PRDFs splits into two subpeaks at 200 GPa, and to show the heterogeneity of MgSiO<sub>3</sub>. Large rings, which form at high pressures, capture the oxygen atoms. Oxygen atoms, which have a negative charge, attract Mg²⁺ ions, creating magnesium-rich regions. Additionally, the Voronoi and Q<sub>n</sub> distribution changes on the ring with pressure are clarified to provide more information about the rings.
